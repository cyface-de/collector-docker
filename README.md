Before you release a new version make sure you:

* Update `JAR_VERSION` in `.github/workflows/publish-docker.yml`

To release a new version:

See https://github.com/cyface-de/data-collector#release-a-new-version[Cyface Collector Readme]

* Just tag the release and push the tag to Github
* After pushing the release tag to Github the CI automatically builds the artifacts and marks the release on Github
